<h2 id=objective>ðŸ“œ About</h2>  
This project originated as a challenge presented by <a href="https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/trilha-net-fundamentos-desafio" target="_blank">DIO</a>. Its primary objective was to develop a parking system enabling users to seamlessly add, list, and remove vehicles, while also providing a mechanism to calculate associated fees. Although the initial project was relatively straightforward, I took the initiative to enhance its functionality. By implementing additional features, I aimed to elevate its realism, striving for a more comprehensive simulation of a genuine parking management system, despite the inherent simplicity of the original task.
